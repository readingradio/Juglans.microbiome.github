#
# does all possible rarefactions
# many NAs because different depths of coverage

# TRUE uses smallest sample size
# first two files without rarefection
# second two average after rarefaction
# third w sd deviation
#
# You can graphically visualize rarefaction curves with R
#
# finally use this command to produce your .subsample.shared file
